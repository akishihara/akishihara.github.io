<h2>Thesis Guidance in Graduate School of Economics (Master and Doctorate)</h2>

<div class="text">

<h3>Fields of Expertise</h3>
<ul>
  <li> I (Akifumi Ishihara) specialize in the analysis of <i>organizations</i>, <i>contract theory</i>, <i>industries and marketing</i> and <i>politics</i>.
	(see also my <a href = "research/index.html">research</a>).
	Basically, I will supervise graduate students interested in <i>theoretical analysis using formal models</i> (e.g. game theory, microeconomics, etc.).
</li>
	<li>Students interested in empirical research on the topics above are recommended to ask another faculty specializing in empirical analysis as their supervisor, though informal consultation and guidance are welcome.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Prerequisites for Master Students</h3>
<ul>
    <li>In the first year of the master programme, you must fulfill the appropriate requirements of the economics course (microeconomics, macroeconomics, and econometrics).
      I recommend taking the corresponding course in Graduate School of Economics instead of Graduate School of Public Policy, whether or not you wish to be enrolled in the doctoral programme.
      (If I am faced with many students requesting supervision, I will only accept those who have taken courses at Graduate School of Economics.)
    </li>
    <li>Please contact me by e-mail to make an appointment during the guidance period
      (usually December for students entering in April, and July for students entering in October).
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Supervision (for Master and Doctoral Students)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I do not give you a research theme for your master's thesis at all.
    Please make sure to <b>find your theme by yourself</b>.
    My role is to help you shape and polish your research theme.
    </li>
  <li>In principle, the thesis guidance will be given on average once a month through individual meetings.
    If there is more than one student, joint meetings may be held.
  </li>
  <li>We make contact regularly by email. <b>Please keep checking your email</b>.
  </li>
  <li>Please let me know when you decide on university-related work (TA, RA, part-time lecturer, etc.) or your next placement (employment, further study, etc.).
	Please also inform me if we need to interrupt your thesis supervision due to, for instance, a leave of absence or withdrawal from school.
  </li>
  <li>Please let me know if you are considering a presentation in a conference or submitting your paper to a refereed journal.
  </li>
  <li>Consultation and guidance with other faculty members (including at other universities) are strongly recommended.
	Feel free to ask me if you wish to change your supervisor from me.
  </li>
  <li>Attend <a href="//www.cirje.e.u-tokyo.ac.jp/research/workshops/micro/micro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microeconomics workshop</a> held by Graduate School of Economics regularly.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Supervision (for Doctoral Students)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If you wish to enter a doctoral programme under my supervision, you must come to me for a consultation at least six months in advance (around October of the previous year for those planning to enter in April, and April for those planning to enter in October).
    </li>
    <li>In addition to <a href="//www.cirje.e.u-tokyo.ac.jp/research/workshops/micro/micro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microeconomics workshop</a>, participation in other research workshops/seminars may also be requested.
      If you are interested, you are also encouraged to attend other research workshops (including those in other universities).
    </li>
